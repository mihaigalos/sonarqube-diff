### Golang

**Important** only manual step: adjust the `gazelle:prefix` in the topmost `BUILD.bazel`.
No need to write any `bazel` BUILD files anywhere, will be generated by `gazelle` based on the folder structure.

```bash
$ bazel run //:gazelle # once, generates BUILD.bazel recursively on all levels.

$ bazel run //:buildifier # as often as needed.
```
